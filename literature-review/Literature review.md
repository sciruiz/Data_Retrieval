# Framing Vulnerabilities: Dengue and Diarrhea in Peru’s Borderlands

In this section, we provide an overview of the literature review conducted on the environmental determinants of diarrheal and dengue diseases, as well as the indicators used to assess vulnerability. The complete literature review can be found in (`Diarrhea Review.xlsx`)[] and (`Dengue Review.xlsx`)[].

## Diarrheal Disease Literature Review on Environmental Determinants and Vulnerability Indicators

**Overview and Scope**
This literature review investigates the relationship between environmental stressors—particularly drought, rainfall, and temperature fluctuations—and the incidence of diarrheal diseases. It also identifies key sociodemographic and adaptive capacity indicators that exacerbate or mitigate vulnerability to such diseases. The reviewed studies range from 2014 to 2021 and span multiple geographies including the Pacific Islands, the United States, Peru, and Korea.

**Methodology**
The review applied a structured search using terms such as “droughts diarrhea”, “diarrhea vulnerability index”, and related variants through Google Scholar. Selection of studies was guided by inclusion criteria emphasizing relevance to climate-linked diarrheal outcomes, measurable associations, and methodological rigor.

To ensure quality and consistency in analysis, three critical appraisal tools were employed:

- PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for systematic reviews (maximum score: 27),
- JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool) for observational studies (maximum score: 8),
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and cross-sectional studies (maximum score: 9).

**Summary of Main Findings**
*Environmental Stressors and Diarrhea Incidence:*

- Temperature increases were positively associated with national-level diarrheal trends in Peru, with stronger associations during El Niño events.

- Heavy rainfall following dry periods significantly increased diarrheal risk, particularly in regions with inadequate water treatment infrastructure.

- Drought conditions were linked to compromised hygiene behaviors and increased household water insecurity, especially among children under five.

*Sociodemographic and Susceptibility Indicators:*

Age emerged consistently as a vulnerability indicator—especially in children under two and between 12–34 months.

Other identified factors included food insecurity, limited hygiene practices, and restricted access to safe water.

Differences in vulnerability by sex and maternal education level were also observed in some datasets.

*Coping and Adaptive Capacity:*

- Coping mechanisms included reliance on government or household water reserves, alternative water sourcing, and water treatment practices.
- Adaptive strategies were less commonly reported but included:
-   Health education interventions,
-   Investment in water treatment infrastructure,
-   Early warning systems related to ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and extreme weather.

*Quality of Evidence:*

- Studies using multivariate analysis and cohort designs generally scored higher on the NOS and JBI tools (e.g., 9/8).
- The sole systematic review achieved a PRISMA score of 24/27, reflecting good methodological rigor though it lacked practical implementation discussion.

**Conclusion**
This review underscores the urgent need for climate-resilient public health systems, particularly in low-resource settings where environmental shocks are increasingly frequent. The most vulnerable populations—young children in water-insecure households—face compounded risks from both environmental exposure and systemic gaps in adaptive capacity.

Future work should prioritize integration of environmental surveillance with public health datasets, and investment in both infrastructural and educational adaptive strategies. Moreover, standardizing methodologies across studies will improve comparability and meta-analytic potential.
